/*
* Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the
* gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty
* (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man!
* Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users'
*  genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male,
*  otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero
* to determine the gender of this user by his method.

Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name.
* This string contains at most 100 letters.

Output
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print
* "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

Examples
inputCopy
wjmzbmr
outputCopy
CHAT WITH HER!
inputCopy
xiaodao
outputCopy
IGNORE HIM!
inputCopy
sevenkplus
outputCopy
CHAT WITH HER!
Note
For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r".
*  So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".
